# little-taco-shop

This project was part of a tutorial from Dave Gray that I did in order to review & improve my HTML skills.

The tutorial can be found at : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA&t=24s

The CSS in this project is my own embellishment and was not required by the tutorial. The logo was created using the Figma. 

Per the tutorial the Live Server extension for VSCode was used to display the page on the browser. Once you download the extension and have this file open in VSCode, click on Go Live on the bottom right of the VSCode footer. 



Directions for this beginners project can be found at https://github.com/gitdagray/html_course/tree/main/10_lesson_starter. The criteria was as follows: 

Directions:

There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files.

All images are provided in the img folder.

If you need to find taco emojis, try Emojipedia.

A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
